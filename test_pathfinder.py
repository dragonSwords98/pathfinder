"""Unit tests for pathfinder.py

Notes: Ideally, splitting test cases can be written into classes and
handled in bulk test suites. It is not ideal to 'loop assertions',
so I have laid out each assertion in explicit manner for legibility.
Assignments should have separate test files for file-folder clarity.
However, with time constraints, I will simplify my layout.
